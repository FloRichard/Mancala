rules.header=Mancala Rules
rules.content=<html><b>Rule 1 :</b> Only 2 players can confront themselves.</br><b>Rule 2 :</b> We share 48 seeds in the 12 holes at the rate of 4 by holes.</br><b>Rule 3 :</b> Each player plays alternatively, the first play to play is chosen randomly. The player takes all the seeds in one of his holes from his side and distribute them, one per hole, counterclockwise.</br><b>Rule 4 :</b> If the last distributed seed ends in one of the opponent''s hole and if there are now 2 or 3 seeds in this hole, the player gets these 2 or 3 seeds and put them aside. Then it looks the previous hole : if it is in the opponent side and contains 2 or 3 seeds, he gets these seeds, and so on until he arrives on his side or until there is a number of seeds different from 2 or 3.</br><b>Rule 5 :</b> We do not skip a hole when we distribute except when we have 12 or more seeds, that is to say we do a complete lap : we do not fill the hole in which we just took seeds.</br><b>Rule 6 :</b> We must « feed » the opponent, that is to say, when he has no more seeds, we must play something that allows him to play on his turn. If this is not possible, the round ends and the player who was about to play catch the remaining seeds.</br><b>Rule 7 :</b> If a move would take all the opponent''s seeds, then the move can be done, but no catch is done : we must not « starve » the opponent.</br><b>Rule 8 :</b> The round ends when :<ul> <li>One of the players caught at least 25 seeds, and is named winner (normal mode)</li><li>Or when there are only 6 seeds on the board and that one of the players has no more seeds on its side and that his opponent did not have the chance to give him some seeds back. (easy mode)</li></ul><b>Rule 9 :</b> If the total number of seeds on the board is less than 6, and no player has more than a total of 24 seeds. The game ends as a draw.</br><b>Rule 10 :</b> A match is composed of 6 rounds, when a player reaches a score of 4, he wins the match. If the score is 3 - 3, the match ends as a draw.</br>Your granary is on the right side and your holes are the ones below.</html>
